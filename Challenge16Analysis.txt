Conclusion:

The number of vine votes compared to non vine votes is huge.  Vine votes were only 2.05% of overall votes.  I think the data is skewed to begin with.
None the less, from the statistics gathered 51.62% of vine votes were 5-star and 60.45% of non-vine votes were 5-star showing on average non paid voters
tended to give a higher rating than paid voters.  The average rating for vine reviews is 4.36 and non-vine is 4.24, those are both close in overall average rating
for both types of reviews.  I would say the vine reviews are not biased.
